Processing sketches.

# Blackboard
A blackboard with three awesome features:
* left button press: draw
* right button press: reset to empty blackboard
* mouse wheel: change circle size

# Audio
This project acquires the input audio signal from the soundcard and plots it.

The background color changes every time the chosen amplitude threshold is reached. 

It is possible to listen to the soundcard stream by pressing the play/stop stream button 
(be careful of the audio feedback effect while reproducing audio).

#TODO add screenshots
